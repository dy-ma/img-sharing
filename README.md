# ImgShare

A modern web application for uploading, organizing, and sharing image sets with ease. Designed for simplicity, speed, and security, this project leverages cutting-edge serverless architecture and cloud-native technologies.

## Features

- **Organize & Share:** Easily upload and share sets of images.
- **Temporary Storage:** Automatically deletes sets after 14 days.
- **Private Sharing:** Share links and QR codes for secure access.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Fast Performance:** Images delivered via Cloudflare R2 for lightning-fast loading.

## Architecture Overview

This project is built on a modern serverless stack, combining powerful tools and platforms:

### Frontend
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Framework:** Next.js 
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 
- **Components:** shadcn/ui

### Backend
- **Cloudflare Workers:** Handles scheduled tasks (e.g., cleaning up expired image sets)
- **Neon Database:** PostgreSQL-based serverless database used for storing metadata about image sets and user details.
- **R2 Object Storage:** Cloudflareâ€™s S3-compatible object storage for storing uploaded images efficiently.

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload:** Users upload image sets via the dashboard.
2. **Image Hosting:** Images are stored in R2 with presigned URLs for secure access.
3. **Metadata Management:** Metadata, including set IDs and timestamps, is stored in the Neon database.
4. **Set Expiry:** A Cloudflare Worker runs daily to identify and delete expired image sets and their associated metadata.
5. **User Access:** Users can share links or QR codes for accessing the sets. Sets expire automatically after 14 days for privacy and cleanup.
